 # Docker compose support intentionally removed

 # The project was simplified to use the lightweight Python demo (Flask + Prometheus
 # metrics collector). Docker Compose was removed to avoid managing container
 # dependencies on the local machine. If you need Docker support later, recreate
 # this file with your desired service definitions.
